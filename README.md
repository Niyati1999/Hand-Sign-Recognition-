# Hand-Sign-Recognition-
• To run project put Real Time Recognition.ipynb and HSR.h5
model in same directory.
• Real Time Recognition.ipynb is using Open-CV library and it’s
functionality, so please install it for smooth and errorless
running.
• Now, if you installed all necessary library packages, run the
python notebook.
• Now you can see three windows open, mask, main window
and taskbar window.
• Main windows will have a green rectangle box, make sure your
hand would fall into that and you create sign language in that
particular region.
• The mask window will show you, how the images are being
passed to the model for prediction.
• You can adjust the lighting level, saturation, histogram from the
taskbar levels.
• Make sure you adjust them as that background would respond
to black and your hand being white as a foreground.
• You can see the predicted letter in left down corner of the main
windows in green color.
• Hope this project fascinates you.
